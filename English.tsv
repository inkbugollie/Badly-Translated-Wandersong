4856	objGreg		Do the same and get in touch with others.	
4857	objGreg		I think I like it	
4858	objGreg		I do not know when I wrote it	
4859	objGreg		What happens after school?	
4860	objGreg		I do not know how many people play this game every day ...	
4861	objGreg		If anyone sees this	
4862	objGreg		But even if you have a coat.	
4863	objGreg		I am poor	
4864	objGreg		Maybe "thank God" ...	
4865	objGreg		But thank you for watching	
4866	objGreg		Then ...	
4867	objGreg		You can create and share anything.	
4868	objGreg		Personal information is important.

4874	objGreg		You can stay here as long as you want.	
4875	objGreg		when he spoke	
4876	objGreg		Let's talk about how this game works.	
4877	objGreg		If you're interested!	
4878	objGreg		good music before you go	
4879	objGreg		I took them to America for five months.	
4880	objGreg		I met many people along the way ...	
4881	objGreg		Nahsob!	
4882	objGreg		I think a lot about life and people.	
4883	objGreg		I want to play this game ...	
4884	objGreg		The first thing I could do was a rainbow car.	
4885	objGreg		Bathrobe.	
4886	objGreg		I need a smart instructor	
4887	objGreg		This is a fun game.	
4888	objGreg		If you see that you need different ideas ...	
4889	objGreg		The waterfall began to flow ...	
4890	objGreg		It took me a long time to see this story.	
4891	objGreg		I had an old plan, but something was missing.	
4892	objGreg		I asked about the goods.	
4893	objGreg		I love my music	
4894	objGreg		I remember calling many while I was there.	
4895	objGreg		That's the point of the story.	
4896	objGreg		My thoughts on history 5.	
4897	objGreg		Create a beautiful world of music	
4898	objGreg		The first operation was performed a few months later.	
4899	objGreg		I've made some changes since then.	
4900	objGreg		But now.	
4901	objGreg		They behave like friends and think they have a chance.	
4902	objGreg		All you need is song and music.	
4903	objGreg		I recorded my voice and tried to imitate all the songs.	
4904	objGreg		I have also written some songs.	
4905	objGreg		But this game requires more than I can handle.	
4906	objGreg		Yes, I know what wisdom is	
4907	objGreg		We need money for that	
4908	objGreg		So Kickstarter is dead.	
4909	objGreg		Kickstarter received a constructive response.	
4910	objGreg		Everyone is very happy.	
4911	objGreg		The game gets fans faster than me.	
4912	objGreg		Many artists are loyal to us.	
4913	objGreg		very special	
4914	objGreg		But I do not know what I'm talking about.	
4915	objGreg		If I ... that's fine

2528	objCommentary		Do you really want to play this game?	
2529	objCommentary		However, many problems arise in this process after sex.	
2531	objCommentary		The idea of the answer is mentioned at the beginning of the first article.	
2532	objCommentary		I think this game is one thing.	
2533	objCommentary		But be patient	
2534	objCommentary		Level 1 and level 2 acceleration ...	
2535	objCommentary		But now the games are ready.	
2536	objCommentary		The roots have already begun.	
2537	objCommentary		am honored to do everything with my voice.	
2538	objCommentary		The market is people.	
2539	objCommentary		What if you have ever known and loved this evil person?	
2540	objCommentary		I know bad guys.	
2541	objCommentary		But I think it fits with part 3 of the Starz study.	
2542	objCommentary		Sorry to see our hero ...	
2543	objCommentary		I did not know the details.	
2544	objCommentary		Hmm ... I'm a little nervous.	
2545	objCommentary		There are three ways to do this.	
2546	objCommentary		Soon I will be drinking coffee while Katya sings.	
2547	objCommentary		Let me remind you of the first few minutes of this article.	
2548	objCommentary		But I saw another interesting impression.	
2549	objCommentary		Football players want to build a history café ...	
2550	objCommentary		I think I lost touch with Chekhov's weapon code.	
2551	objCommentary		There were signs in the Lord's basket.	
2552	objCommentary		I like a lot of things. This can cause noise.	
2553	objCommentary		Thank you for the opportunity to participate in regular sports.	
2554	objCommentary		I really like this game.	
2555	objCommentary		Drunk love with stories and characters ...	
2556	objCommentary		How stupid is Captain Lucas, right?	
2557	objCommentary		saw a beautiful woman ...	
2558	objCommentary		Find the love and gift you want ...	
2559	objCommentary		Wet weather	
2560	objCommentary		But the prison escapes	
2561	objCommentary		But the most important thing is how much you love her.	
2562	objCommentary		So he's more comfortable than Marcus.	
2563	objCommentary		I love the advice here.	
2564	objCommentary		I made a sheet of paper by uploading an image at the back of the screen ...	
2565	objCommentary		Plants and water are important.	
2566	objCommentary		But I do not know.	
2567	objCommentary		Okay	
2568	objCommentary		So when the final decision is made, the leader dies.	
2569	objCommentary		I decided to use it again.	
2570	objCommentary		It looks good	
2571	objCommentary		Always think about what can be recycled before making anything new.	
2572	objCommentary		I think this general rule is much better.	
2573	objCommentary		The third action is about waves and space.	
2574	objCommentary		The main goal is to change ...	
2575	objCommentary		Example: "Shift".	
2576	objCommentary		Normal shape is determined by plates.	
2577	objCommentary		this is the principle	
2578	objCommentary		Shipping, delivery and arrival slips.	
2579	objCommentary		III. This episode is about chaos.	
2580	objCommentary		I like to touch.	
2581	objCommentary		Therefore, you should think and sing without choosing style.	
2582	objCommentary		The distance between the strings is not allowed.	
2583	objCommentary		(Or an ad ... an example to help you read this text.)	
2584	objCommentary		This cable is very complex.	
2585	objCommentary		That means you are not ready yet.	
2586	objCommentary		At least ...	
2587	objCommentary		I do not like this place	
2588	objCommentary		Molecules are very strong because they are small.	
2589	objCommentary		It is worth it!	
2590	objCommentary		I was waiting for you	
2591	objCommentary		I thought I heard the game ...	
2592	objCommentary		Discount requires all gaming power.	
2593	objCommentary		And that makes it part of the game.	
2594	objCommentary		Although he had small wounds, he was brave and inventive.	
2595	objCommentary		Do you know other short courses / bachelors?	
2596	objCommentary		Still, it reminds me of a good structure in the game.	
2597	objCommentary		I think Audrey Megaman can fight at any level in Overwatch.	
2598	objCommentary		But only time will tell.	
2599	objCommentary		That's why they know him by his voice.	
2600	objCommentary		Let's play this game.	
2601	objCommentary		But I was very disappointed.	
2602	objCommentary		There are many ways to believe ...	
2603	objCommentary		like to play football with a knife.	
2604	objCommentary		Then turn it in one direction to the next.	
2605	objCommentary		I live on a golf course ...	
2606	objCommentary		The fourth commandment changes from generation to generation.	
2607	objCommentary		I have always believed that disease wins war.	
2608	objCommentary		But the first example is a snow-covered city.	
2609	objCommentary		"Learning community" everywhere ... Visitors ...	
2610	objCommentary		The walls are not badly decorated.	
2611	objCommentary		I think it's just a matter of time.	
2612	objCommentary		But I do not know what it is in urban sports.	
2613	objCommentary		Season 4 begins with an introduction to Stardew Valley.	
2614	objCommentary		You're crazy ...

2616	objCommentary		Good idea, another pancake with a black tip ...	
2617	objCommentary		I will try	
2618	objCommentary		The game gets very intense.	
2619	objCommentary		It is not easy to write NPC projects from one day to the next.	
2620	objCommentary		I loved this part of the game.	
2621	objCommentary		Direct bonus.	
2622	objCommentary		I thought differently.	
2623	objCommentary		Peter does not think he really loves Mary. I wrote the first interview before.	
2624	objCommentary		As i understand it	
2625	objCommentary		The link will be removed until you see the link.	
2626	objCommentary		I play on the street.	
2627	objCommentary		The word "student" is often heard in school.	
2628	objCommentary		But I decided to talk about the fourth line.	
2629	objCommentary		Sweep!	
2630	objCommentary		I asked the translator John Robert Matz.	
2631	objCommentary		Now it's okay.	
2632	objCommentary		This work is very powerful.	
2633	objCommentary		Sound is one of the leading causes of hearing loss.	
2634	objCommentary		It was one of the best ideas I had when I started this song.	
2635	objCommentary		But I think Santa's in the game.	
2636	objCommentary		An angry angel, actor ...	
2637	objCommentary		But before that, the thieves jumped in one after the other.	
2638	objCommentary		They play musical instruments and sing.	
2639	objCommentary		Turn your music into something beautiful and powerful.	
2640	objCommentary		This game contains a few key elements.	
2641	objCommentary		But the most amazing thing is that this idea completely changed the performance.	
2642	objCommentary		It will take time to solve this problem.	
2643	objCommentary		So the details are a bit refined.	
2644	objCommentary		Virtually everyone works in a factory.	
2645	objCommentary		When the PTO shaft "kicks", the engine starts.	
2646	objCommentary		therefore it is not possible	
2647	objCommentary		I can not wait to see you again	
2648	objCommentary		This is my first thought of "something" in verse 4.	
2649	objCommentary		In the beginning, this behavior is difficult to change.	
2650	objCommentary		How	
2651	objCommentary		The process has changed a lot.	
2652	objCommentary		I still have "messages" and comments to post it.	
2653	objCommentary		Major problem ...	
2654	objCommentary		There is no reason to kill a malfunctioning production.	
2655	objCommentary		Everyone in the house is complaining.	
2656	objCommentary		stay with him?	
2657	objCommentary		I think it will change the whole team ...	
2658	objCommentary		Robot or industry ...	
2659	objCommentary		Unfortunately ... that name can be "unique".	
2660	objCommentary		But I promised something else.	
2661	objCommentary		A big part of that is learning good music.	
2662	objCommentary		I do not want to bother you, but ...	
2663	objCommentary		Exactly as I have seen here.	
2664	objCommentary		Bad things can happen in the Czech Republic.	
2665	objCommentary		So I added new news to everyone.

2680	objCommentary		Cities often become uninhabited.	
2681	objCommentary		Therefore, astronomers often draw circles.	
2682	objCommentary		Since the game is "a picture" ...	
2683	objCommentary		I love funny actors and world class songs.	
2684	objCommentary		I touch Maria's face in the comments.	
2685	objCommentary		YOUNG! Do you want to be a story hero? ...	
2686	objCommentary		But he is your leader	
2687	objCommentary		Parents	
2688	objCommentary		It helps people realize that they are not heroes.	
2689	objCommentary		We remove the content when prompted.	
2690	objCommentary		I would like to play this game for a long time.	
2691	objCommentary		This can be part of the "hard" part of the game.	
2692	objCommentary		I'm scared to go out.	
2693	objCommentary		But I think it is an effective and interesting approach.	
2694	objCommentary		That said, your first visit to the spirit world.

2702	objCommentary		The last big change I made was over time.	
2703	objCommentary		More! you almost feel yourself	
2704	objCommentary		Sometimes they do not allow players to control the clock speed ...	
2705	objCommentary		It's hard to worry about opening an account.	
2706	objCommentary		Standard version ...	
2707	objCommentary		But if the whole process goes slowly, nothing will change.	
2708	objCommentary		Your difference is huge.	
2709	objCommentary		... That's all	
2710	objCommentary		I do not want to understand anyone	
2711	objCommentary		But if you always follow your teeth ...	
2712	objCommentary		I love the composer Stephen.	
2713	objCommentary		They are actually better than the wild animals.	
2714	objCommentary		But this song about God's creation is only 69 seconds long.	
2715	objCommentary		Finally the angel said:	
2716	objCommentary		I will stay here forever	
2717	objCommentary		Before I started this book, I had no idea that Richie and the main characters had so many problems.	
2718	objCommentary		I'm scared of him!	
2719	objCommentary		I want to break the rules of good law.	
2720	objCommentary		It takes a long time for the queen to know what the law is.	
2721	objCommentary		This is one of the first things I want to talk about in this game.	
2722	objCommentary		It has a key and looks like a calendar.	
2723	objCommentary		However, time is badly needed these days.	
2724	objCommentary		This is the last point	
2725	objCommentary		it's hard for us

2733	objCommentary		He was definitely ready.	
2734	objCommentary		I also learned many aspects of mental health.	
2736	objCommentary		This spiritual warfare is real. I'm happy to be a part of it.

2748	objCommentary		Sort by folder "Companies".	
2749	objCommentary		This is how the whole match went.	
2750	objCommentary		But they return to the forest and do not know what has happened.	
2751	objCommentary		I give them.	
2752	objCommentary		Right now I want a fifth gift.	
2753	objCommentary		At the start of the match, the mood changed drastically.	
2754	objCommentary		I feel lost	
2755	objCommentary		He was slightly worried and became very anxious.	
2756	objCommentary		When I look back, I respect everything.	
2757	objCommentary		I do not know where I'm going

2760	objCommentary		Difficult decision...	
2761	objCommentary		He also thought he would turn into a monster.

2771	objCommentary		Think about the words, draw a picture and answer the mistakes.	
2772	objCommentary		Below is a brief description of each part of the game.	
2773	objCommentary		I remember how hard it was to watch season 5.	
2774	objCommentary		But at the beginning of the book, I was shocked.	
2775	objCommentary		Each weight on the list is 1: 1 per. game.	
2776	objCommentary		I need details and a resume!	
2777	objCommentary		Society is a whole country between different regions.	
2778	objCommentary		I know what the poet said to the king.	
2779	objCommentary		I do not know what will happen when he comes here.	
2780	objCommentary		The concept of icon / screen saver is slowly appearing.	
2781	objCommentary		Looking back, I do not know.	
2782	objCommentary		I just wrote ...	
2783	objCommentary		I understand how this affects Mary and the whole game.	
2784	objCommentary		I learned Chinese, my name is Xia Tian.	
2785	objCommentary		The fifth part is called Siri and the fifth part is called Zin.	
2786	objCommentary		So I write his name down for my city. It means "under the sun".	
2787	objCommentary		I did the same for my neighbor Jim. Jimmy finds his way and becomes a hero ...!)	
2788	objCommentary		He said he could learn Chinese.	
2789	objCommentary		And he looked at the picture	
2790	objCommentary		In short, the road is not easy.	
2791	objCommentary		This type of paper is used for the first time.	
2792	objCommentary		That's why I added this feature.	
2793	objCommentary		I wondered how other mental concepts are treated ...	
2794	objCommentary		The wind scared her, she had no choice but to stay.

2796	objCommentary		But when the idea of flowers came to my mind, I became overjoyed.	
2797	objCommentary		He overcame obstacles and broke the law	
2798	objCommentary		So that's not a bad thing at all.	
2799	objCommentary		But in this case, it's better.

2812	objCommentary		I'm not here	
2813	objCommentary		asked the stranger	
2814	objCommentary		But I know the game is like that.	
2815	objCommentary		Some things need to change.	
2816	objCommentary		Print ...	
2817	objCommentary		I left the game.	
2818	objCommentary		therefore it is not possible	
2819	objCommentary		About the sun and the moon	
2820	objCommentary		The actual limits listed in section 5 are "smoke and mirrors".

2822	objCommentary		Play a little ...	
2823	objCommentary		You can adjust default music settings ... or ...	
2824	objCommentary		But this game is very technical.	
2825	objCommentary		Remember your friend's song ...	
2826	objCommentary		I think it will take a long time.	
2827	objCommentary		Yes you can agree with him.	
2828	objCommentary		But when I got there, I was thinking about how to end the game.

2843	objCommentary		Yes, this wonderful song will continue.	
2844	objCommentary		Tell a good story to hear what the players think during the game.	
2845	objCommentary		Because there is a way to find the most popular games.	
2846	objCommentary		I like to be open to the opinions of others and enjoy doing so.	
2847	objCommentary		To keep the structure simple, it introduces certain limitations.	
2848	objCommentary		Or against it ...

2890	objCommentary		I saw the same idea in another game.	
2891	objCommentary		But it is much easier to develop a concept.

2906	objCommentary		I love this game.	
2907	objCommentary		It's interesting how the game structure changes when the game environment changes ...	
2908	objCommentary		How can you be a part of the story?	
2909	objCommentary		It's hard to catch.	
2910	objCommentary		I was distracted for a while.	
2911	objCommentary		Start looking for beauty.	
2912	objCommentary		ANIMALS will come to you.	
2913	objCommentary		Lots of pictures and pictures ...	
2914	objCommentary		Great patron	
2915	objCommentary		Everything is healthy "good".	
2916	objCommentary		This is a magic recipe.	
2917	objCommentary		This is the hardest part.	
2918	objCommentary		Big questions and challenges ...	
2919	objCommentary		think it was a fantastic match ...	
2920	objCommentary		with armadillos	
2921	objCommentary		But that's hard to explain.	
2922	objCommentary		I am honest! Transport	
2923	objCommentary		Alone or deaf?	
2924	objCommentary		The fight is very difficult.	
2925	objCommentary		Be "right" and be honest.	
2926	objCommentary		I'm very worried and sick.	
2927	objCommentary		The big elephant in the room moved me with every movement.	
2928	objCommentary		And the recipe ...	
2929	objCommentary		Oops ...	
2930	objCommentary		You know my darling ...	
2931	objCommentary		I will work later ...	
2932	objCommentary		This is a religion.	
2933	objCommentary		Otherwise, there is no hope. Like me	
2934	objCommentary		I do not like.	
2935	objCommentary		I want to teach you.	
2936	objCommentary		on the hill	
2937	objCommentary		I have written a review about this online game.	
2938	objCommentary		We look forward to your play ...	
2939	objCommentary		I like the big song.	
2940	objCommentary		However, we came to a completely different conclusion.	
2941	objCommentary		I spent a lot of time searching for citizens on Google Earth and Wikipedia.	
2942	objCommentary		This is where Chiren falls.	
2943	objCommentary		Eventually, he visited Everest Base Camp.	
2944	objCommentary		I put the final result in the game.	
2945	objCommentary		this is not the best way	
2946	objCommentary		Can't find the link? and I went	
2947	objCommentary		so I forgot	
2948	objCommentary		I stopped	
2949	objCommentary		Then you get the "right" ...	
2950	objCommentary		He was reading at the same time as my friend Celeste.	
2951	objCommentary		Note that "ten", funny ...	
2952	objCommentary		At the end of the process, a "text" is generated to describe the location of the action.	
2953	objCommentary		some fans	
2954	objCommentary		We have to break it.	
2955	objCommentary		I tried using Master Bird again.	
2956	objCommentary		Block this	
2957	objCommentary		But do not try.	
2958	objCommentary		Let the birds take care of you first. like most pictures	
2959	objCommentary		But the beauty of the game is the dangerous and inhuman characters.	
2960	objCommentary		I do not have time	
2961	objCommentary		So I decided to "squeeze" this bird by writing a code.	
2962	objCommentary		So this key is very good and right.	
2963	objCommentary		Thus, the "bone" forms the head of the extruded bird.	
2964	objCommentary		Like the last two stories of Daas VI and VII, it is widely used.	
2965	objCommentary		But sometimes it's fun to play football.	
2966	objCommentary		Then he hit ...	
2967	objCommentary		When you look at it, it looks very different.	
2968	objCommentary		You can see the pictures in this section. But when it explodes, it turns into a "cut cloud".	
2969	objCommentary		Bard Troll text added at the end.	
2970	objCommentary		I really like the sixth season.	
2971	objCommentary		Talk to animals and encourage them to "understand the language".	
2972	objCommentary		But all is well.	
2973	objCommentary		I think it's important to know the players to avoid this confusion.	
2974	objCommentary		There is a "transition phase" from speech to pantomime	
2975	objCommentary		Sixth "Team" Exercise.	
2976	objCommentary		Look at the pictures to get some great ideas. Both are animals.	
2977	objCommentary		If something goes wrong, there is no going back	
2978	objCommentary		This is one of the most important things in the game.	
2979	objCommentary		Well, the head is too long, but short.	
2980	objCommentary		Do you want to sell ...	
2981	objCommentary		"You have to ask !!!	
2982	objCommentary		The title is very interesting.	
2983	objCommentary		hluba ...	
2984	objCommentary		As a parent, CN is scared.	
2985	objCommentary		I will try.	
2986	objCommentary		as I said	
2987	objCommentary		Very good ... fantastic!	
2988	objCommentary		Basically, the game aims to spread the idea of global love.	
2989	objCommentary		So if you see a dangerous player	
2990	objCommentary		How ...	
2991	objCommentary		plum	
2992	objCommentary		Men "Nagbos" ...	
2993	objCommentary		There's a stupid computer called an alarm clock.	
2994	objCommentary		I want to talk to him	
2995	objCommentary		I want to introduce a lot of absurd characters like Tian Shields.	
2996	objCommentary		How ...	
2997	objCommentary		This song is inspired by Celeste.	
2998	objCommentary		Number 4 is the most popular news channel "Satu".	
2999	objCommentary		I like the weather	
3000	objCommentary		at the end of this line	
3001	objCommentary		no but yes	
3002	objCommentary		The model is bigger than I thought.	
3003	objCommentary		These games are connected, right?	
3004	objCommentary		When I stopped writing ... I was surprised that Audrey was so dangerous.	
3005	objCommentary		Your life is simple.	
3006	objCommentary		In other words, I lost a lot.	
3007	objCommentary		This match was canceled last season.	
3008	objCommentary		do not overheat	
3009	objCommentary		It looked like fire rather than snow.	
3010	objCommentary		I think Paris is beautiful.	
3011	objCommentary		Kurt did a great job.	
3012	objCommentary		I voted for the teacher	
3013	objCommentary		You can not decorate clothes	
3014	objCommentary		I have a million ideas and solutions.	
3015	objCommentary		Construction is difficult, some doors are closed.	
3016	objCommentary		Audrey is looking for a way out ...	
3017	objCommentary		Each group has its own characteristics.	
3018	objCommentary		He meets Audrey and Mimo to pick up the sword.	
3019	objCommentary		The plane is flying low.	
3020	objCommentary		Incognito and landing in the wolf town Odra. Transport	
3021	objCommentary		It is absolutely historic. But this is not true.	
3022	objCommentary		I decided to leave because I was too sick.	
3023	objCommentary		I knew they would follow me after that trip.	
3024	objCommentary		Speaking of "safety", let's move on to the first part.	
3025	objCommentary		Short answer. "Games" is also a joke.	
3026	objCommentary		But it is not necessary.	
3027	objCommentary		I think it's important to build "defense" in this war.	
3028	objCommentary		We are blind!	
3029	objCommentary		The word "background" describes how players play the game ...	
3030	objCommentary		Yes, that's a good number.	
3031	objCommentary		Here is the first screenshot of the game ...	
3032	objCommentary		Stop it like that. Transport	
3033	objCommentary		want to know how to remove the door.	
3034	objCommentary		His "desires" are one of the main reasons.	
3035	objCommentary		Pushing the player "to the left" has other important consequences.	
3036	objCommentary		I do not know ...	
3037	objCommentary		But how can you get back to the old habits and work ...	
3038	objCommentary		plum	
3039	objCommentary		Behind the star is yet another first gay ring.	
3040	objCommentary		We often see meteorites in the spirit world.	
3041	objCommentary		But now I am "in the real world" ...	
3042	objCommentary		It's not just a good team ...! They fell to the ground.	
3043	objCommentary		almost everything is going well	
3044	objCommentary		This song is inspired by the beloved Celeste.	
3045	objCommentary		Big climb VI	
3046	objCommentary		He turned children's songs into music.	
3047	objCommentary		I quickly realized I wanted a "Factory" dream king.	
3048	objCommentary		But sometimes that type of game changes his mind.	
3050	objCommentary		I think a good King of Fantasy Strike game needs a secret.	
3051	objCommentary		Use the power of music to create light.	
3052	objCommentary		But the more you talk ...	
3053	objCommentary		Audrey's opponent is better than her.	
3054	objCommentary		I want to think about war here.	
3055	objCommentary		The CEO of Dream King is Audrey Heim.	
3056	objCommentary		The final design contributes to the overall result.	
3057	objCommentary		The first vision that emerged during the war was the first attempt to concentrate on sixth place.	
3058	objCommentary		The characteristics of each organization are different.	
3059	objCommentary		If nothing is done, the result changes.	
3061	objCommentary		After all, war is the most difficult time in history ...	
3062	objCommentary		I lift my head and say "epic".	
3063	objCommentary		But I quickly realized I needed to rest.	
3064	objCommentary		"Sniper" is the best trophy I've ever seen.	
3065	objCommentary		I will try to pass this idea on to the factory.	
3066	objCommentary		They make videos like this. But it should be different.	
3067	objCommentary		After criticism, Audrey decided to become a star.	
3068	objCommentary		As an athlete, I feel strong and adaptable.	
3069	objCommentary		This "last day" theory is 100% true.	
3070	objCommentary		After playing with tattoos and clothes, it is recommended that you play the entire game.	
3071	objCommentary		Combine colors, create and sew all the time ...	
3072	objCommentary		Calmness is a sign of the "feet".	
3073	objCommentary		He is the greatest	
3074	objCommentary		This is a comprehensive discussion of how it works under development.	
3075	objCommentary		Excellent advice ...	
3076	objCommentary		The band automatically starts playing and returns to play the song.	
3077	objCommentary		I was busy writing the song "Aqikat".	
3078	objCommentary		Then "replace" the image with sound and tone ...	
3079	objCommentary		As the image of God, we are pure in our understanding of His true nature.	
3080	objCommentary		But I would say that this country is "criminal".	
3081	objCommentary		it was a good start	
3082	objCommentary		I told her the truth. '	
3083	objCommentary		I think this is stronger than the previous post.	
3084	objCommentary		in other games	
3085	objCommentary		I do not know what to believe	
3086	objCommentary		(read first)	
3087	objCommentary		It was clear that the use of these technologies was life threatening.	
3088	objCommentary		But it's a good idea.	
3089	objCommentary		This is good because nothing can change.	
3090	objCommentary		We need to focus on our work and improve our gaming behavior.	
3091	objCommentary		It is not necessary to create new ideas.	
3092	objCommentary		Everything I do here is based on a previous song.	
3093	objCommentary		The last sentence has been much criticized.	
3094	objCommentary		I have a vision and it's been two weeks since I wrote this project.	
3095	objCommentary		Your voice is weak.	
3096	objCommentary		But I remember liking other artists' ideas.	
3097	objCommentary		I want to use the apartment.	
3098	objCommentary		try a little	
3099	objCommentary		To find a user, search.	
3100	objCommentary		This made him "think" about entering the world of sports.	
3101	objCommentary		Create a small family website, not a data group.	
3102	objCommentary		Think of a design that recognizes your ideas ...	
3103	objCommentary		Maybe we are not better than ourselves?	
3104	objCommentary		Examples of the latest sports updates:	
3105	objCommentary		Thank you for your participation.
